      My name is Rituja Singh. I am a 20 years old, Faridabad girl. I am a student of BBA at Indian Institute of Management, Rohtak. I am currently in the final year. My family consists of father, mother and a younger brother. My father is in business sector and owns a retail outlet. My mother works in education sector. My brother aims to be a Chartered Accountant. Arshika is my best friend. My hobbies are reading and binge watching web series. I also maintain a kitchen garden. Gardening gives me a sense of purpose and peace. I've done a lot of research projectd under professors of IIM Rohtak on various topics. I want to pursue a career in corporate. My inclination is towards Marketing and HR domains.

        <dd><em>My hobby is to try various activities. As a matter of fact, I have 5 low-cost hobbies, low-cost because now I am a student and I cannot afford my hobbies to burn a hole in my pocket. These are writing, cooking, bird-watching, photography with my phone and learning new languages. I have taught myself to speak in Spanish and German thanks to numerous YouTube videos, Google translate and Duolingo app. I feel this hobby is constantly adding value to my profile.</em></dd>
